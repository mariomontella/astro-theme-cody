Open source AI and software development is the new hotness and is generating alot of buzz. Rightfully so, however, I’d like to reflect on why this is healthy and important for global growth. OpenAI, a non-profit AI research organization, (is) was leading the way in open source development. With the recent exposure of an internal memo within Google, it’s clear the issue was really underestimating the wealth, value and sheer potential of the pooled knowledge that exists within the open source community.

Open source software development allows businesses to access cutting-edge technology without having to invest in expensive proprietary systems. It also allows developers to share their code with each other, making it easier for businesses to collaborate on projects and develop innovative products faster.

Open source also helps promote business development by encouraging collaboration between developers from different countries, allowing them to work together on projects that can benefit everyone. This type of collaboration can lead to better products and services that can help drive economic growth around the world. This is actually a good thing, and healthy for the global ecosystem.

However, this also means that instead of playing monopoly, we’ll be playing snakes and ladders. I’m good with that, because the old days of monopolizing software and it’s development should be a thing of the past, like Steve Ballmer and the love/hate relationship everyone had for anything Microsoft. I wonder what changed?

Monopolies can lead to higher costs of use for technology and make it difficult for new companies to enter the market due to lack of access. Additionally, monopolies can stifle innovation by preventing competition in the market and reducing incentives for companies to invest in research and development. This could ultimately lead to slower economic growth and development in the long run.

Footnote: I didn’t mention obvious concerns of the potential for misuse by those who have less than legitimate interests, though I weigh that on the same scale with all the pros & cons of cryptocurrency. Basically, I never liked playing monopoly anyway.
